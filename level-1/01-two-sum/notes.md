## âœ… Problem Understanding

- What is the problem asking?
so, we have a target eg. 9 and we have find the combination 2 numbers from array which sum up to 9 and then we have to return their indexes! nums[i] + nums[j] == target

- What are edge cases?

    - âœ… [1, 2], target = 3 â†’ Minimum length input
    - âœ… [3, 3], target = 6 â†’ Same number used at different indices
    - âœ… [-3, 4, 1], target = -2 â†’ Negative numbers
    - âœ… [0, 4, 3, 0], target = 0 â†’ Zeros in array
    - âœ… [10^9, -10^9], target = 0 â†’ Large numbers
    - âœ… [1, 2, 3, 4], target = 5 â†’ Multiple valid pairs exist (return any one)
    - âœ… [4, 1, 2, 3], target = 6 â†’ Unsorted input

## ðŸ§© Approach

- Describe the logic in simple words.

Make a map to store numbers and their indexes.
For each number, check if target - number is in the map.
If yes, return their indexes.
Else, store the number with its index.
