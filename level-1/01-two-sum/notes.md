## ✅ Problem Understanding

- What is the problem asking?
so, we have a target eg. 9 and we have find the combination 2 numbers from array which sum up to 9 and then we have to return their indexes! nums[i] + nums[j] == target

- What are edge cases?

- ✅ [1, 2], target = 3 → Minimum length input
- ✅ [3, 3], target = 6 → Same number used at different indices
- ✅ [-3, 4, 1], target = -2 → Negative numbers
- ✅ [0, 4, 3, 0], target = 0 → Zeros in array
- ✅ [10^9, -10^9], target = 0 → Large numbers
- ✅ [1, 2, 3, 4], target = 5 → Multiple valid pairs exist (return any one)
- ✅ [4, 1, 2, 3], target = 6 → Unsorted input
